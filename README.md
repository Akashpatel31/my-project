Full Stack Project with React, Node.js, and Docker
This project demonstrates a full stack application using React for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, and Docker for containerization. The backend serves an API, and the frontend fetches and displays the data from the backend.

Project Structure
backend/: Contains the Node.js backend code.
frontend/: Contains the React frontend code.
docker-compose.yml: The Docker Compose configuration to run both services.
.gitignore: To ignore unnecessary files like node_modules/ and dist/.
README.md: This file.
Requirements
Docker
Node.js (for local development)
Git (for version control)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
Build and run with Docker Compose:

You can use Docker Compose to build and run both the frontend and backend services.

bash
Copy
Edit
docker-compose up --build
This will build both the frontend and backend images and start the containers.

Access the application:

Frontend: http://localhost:5173/
Backend: http://localhost:5001/
Backend Setup (Node.js with Express)
The backend is a simple Node.js application using Express. It serves a basic API at the root URL (/) that returns a JSON message.

The backend listens on port 5001.
Frontend Setup (React)
The frontend is built with React and uses Vite for development and production builds.

The frontend is built into a static application using Vite, served by Nginx in the Docker container.
The frontend fetches data from the backend (http://localhost:5001/).
Docker Compose Setup
The docker-compose.yml file defines two services: frontend and backend.

The frontend service builds the React application and serves it using Nginx.
The backend service runs the Node.js application.
Both services are connected via a custom Docker network app-network.

Additional Information
CORS: To allow the frontend (React) to communicate with the backend (Node.js), CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is enabled on the backend server.
.gitignore: Make sure to ignore unnecessary files such as node_modules/ and build directories.
Troubleshooting
If the frontend is not showing data from the backend, ensure that both the frontend and backend containers are running.
Check the console for any CORS issues or errors related to the API request.
Ensure that localhost:5001 is accessible from the frontend container when using Docker.
This README.md provides all the necessary information about setting up, building, and running the project, as well as some context on the file structure and usage of Docker and Docker Compose.
