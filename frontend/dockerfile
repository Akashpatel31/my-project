# Step 1: Build the application
FROM node:20 AS build

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies
COPY frontend/package.json frontend/package-lock.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the frontend source code
COPY frontend/ .

# Build the Vite application
RUN npm run build

# Step 2: Serve the application with Nginx (you can use other servers like serve)
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the built Vite files to Nginx's HTML folder
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose the port Nginx will run on
EXPOSE 80

# Start Nginx to serve the built app
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
